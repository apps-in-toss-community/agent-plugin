'@ait-co/agent-plugin': patch
---

docs(skills): align `docs` skill resolver with actual content structure (root `intro`, `api/<group>/index.mdx`, `guides/`); drop unbacked sections (`getting-started`, `recipes`, `reference`) from the spec but keep them as future-extension hooks. Implement `status` skill (was placeholder) on top of `aitcc whoami` / `app ls` / `app status` — read-only console summary.
